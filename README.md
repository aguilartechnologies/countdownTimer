## How To Customize

- The script.js file contains the countdown timer's set date on line 6 ...
    - const newYears = '1 Jan 2022' ;
- Simply change "1 Jan 2022" to the desired date while following the same format and the timer will be set accordingly. Change text accordingly as well that would describe the occasion for the timer.
